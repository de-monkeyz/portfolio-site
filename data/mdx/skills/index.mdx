I've been building web applications professionally now for almost a decade.

<!-- end -->

That's a little scary when I really think about it, especially when I consider
that I've been creating apps, websites, and little tools for almost 15 years as
a hobby as well. When I look back on all that time spent at a desk tapping away
at keys, and being in length discussions with colleagues about what goes where,
I find myself being unable to really put a limit on the list of skills that I've
gained and honed throughout all those experiences.

I'll be honest, this page was originally going to be a long read... a really long
read. Mind numbingly long if you can imagine that. When I thought about the
purpose of this page however, I realised that anyone coming to this section
probably doesn't really care about the ramblings of some guy they've never met
before. Not to mention it was coming off as really dry and pretentious.

So I'll keep it simple (and leave the rambling for a future blog post):

I'm Ash. I'm a software engineer, specifically I'm a
Web Frontend Engineer. I like what I do, and I like talking about it. My main
tehnical skills pretty much in that classic frontend wheelhouse: react,
javascript, typescript, you know, the whole gang. If you want
to see my thoughts on them, my gripes, the things I really love, or just double
check that I'm not full of it. Please read the pages linked below.

Thanks for your time.
