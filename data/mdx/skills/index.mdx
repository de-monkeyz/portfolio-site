I've been building web applications professionally now for almost a decade.

That's a little scary when I really think about it, especially when I consider
that I've been creating apps, websites, and little tools for almost 15 years as
a hobby as well. When I look back on all that time spent at a desk tapping away
at keys, and being in length discussions with colleagues about what goes where,
I find myself being unable to really put a limit on the list of skills that I've
gained and honed throughout all those experiences.

Having a really long list of (buzz)words explaining what I can do, or what I
have done isn't all that useful anyway, for me or anyone else. So for this
"digital résumé" I'd rather focus the skills that I end up using the most, the
ones that I've honed after hours and hours of practise; making mistakes,
"eureka!" moments, and all the inbetween.

Below you'll find a curated list of the skills that I'm the most fond of, it's
by no means an exhaustive list, but rather a list of skills that I feel that I
can talk off your ear about if you let me.
