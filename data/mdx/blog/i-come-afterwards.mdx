<Warning>

Be warned! Things are about to get incredibly long winded, and perhaps a
little rambly. If you want to get to the "good stuff" just jump to [my
technical skills](#pages) now, or maybe save yourself and read
[an entertaining obsession with coffee](/interests/coffee) instead

</Warning>

If I just listed everything off here, one after another, I don't think I'd
really paint a picture of what I actually know, and what I'm proud of as an
engineer. In fact- I think I'd just end up saying nothing by saying everything.
So for what I have dubbed as my "digital rÃ©sumÃ©" I'd like to take the time to
concentrate on the skills that I think are the most valuable day to day and
write those down on this page. This may get rather autobiographical...
so get comfy.

As for knowledge of technical stacks... I'll leave that to some separate, more
focused pages (which you can find at the bottom of this page).
Whatever stack, framework, or language I use in the here and now
doesn't really affect who I am as an engineer, at the very core at least.
However I am still very happy to talk your ear off about the ones I like. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Product Development

Jumping right in, I think this is the big one: it's a skill I use every day,
something that I've worked hard at, and to be honest dedicated the most time
to learning outside of technical tasks. By far it was the most daunting,
exhausting, and exciting to learn.

My early career, didn't really involve a lot of product. In fact the first 3-4
years of working professionally was almost entire agency based work- not
something that lends itself to iterative approach to design, development, or
anything else really. Whilst I can't say I didn't learn anything from those
experiences (it definitely beat resilience into me!), I always felt like I
lacked a quality that I couldn't quite place. It wasn't until I started working
full time on product that I started to make the distinction between an
"engineer" and a "developer".

As I continue to write more on this site, I may come back to these two phrases.
But the long and short of it in my mind is developers write code,
engineers **design and build software**. Now I'm aware that I might be painting
very broad strokes here, but this is merely an opinion I hold when looking at
myself, and only myself&mdash; it is only when I started thinking about
everything outside of code that I felt like I had become an engineer.

With that little jaunt down memory lane out of the way, let's actually talk
about it: Product Development. I'm not going to be super in-depth here as I'm
by no means the leading expert on the topic, and there's plenty of articles,
books, and talks authored by people with a lot more clout than myself that
you can go and find.

I would however like to at least convince you that I know what I'm talking about,
at least a little bit.

If you made it this far, well done; thanks for reading. If I've not bored you
with my essay, or you've skipped to this part to find some actual technical info
about my abilities- please read any of the linked pages below.
